# About me

I'm **programmer**. I've programmed on different languages: Python, C, C++, C#, Rust, Assembler, Lua, Java, and so on. And I **loved** all of them, because everyone has its own charm! Different implementations of the same features, opinion on variable management, paradigms.

I'm also a gamer. Played many games and a lot, especially Minecraft and various Sonic fangames! But there are many games which I'm interested playing. Over the years I have played from Hearts of Iron 4 to Subnautica, from Celeste to Hollow Knight.
